Dr. Jun Gu is currently working as an assistant professor in Accounnting and Finance from Department of Accounting, College of Economics, Shenzhen University. He received his doctorate degree in Accounting and Finance in 2014 from [Lancaster University Management School](https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/lums/) under the supervision of [Professor John O'Hanlon](https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/lums/people/john-ohanlon) and [Professor Ken Peasnell](https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/lums/people/ken-peasnell), and his master's degree in Accounting (by research) from [zhongnan University of Economics and Law](http://kjxy.zuel.edu.cn/) under the supervision of [Professor Xiongyuan Wang](http://faculty.zuel.edu.cn/kjxy/wxy/list.htm). His research interest covers a wide range of fields taht include:

- **Accounting Issues in Financial Institutions and for Financial Instruments:**

  This is a popular topic since the recent financial crunch in United States one decade ago (in 2006) that reuslted in great panic globally. One of many controversies that lays in front of many practitioners, regulators and academicians in the field of accounting is that *in which aspect and how accounting standard settings can really impact the unordered market*. in particular, people are asking about whether *financial instruments* are recognised and are measured in a fair way, and that financial institutions are regulated appropriately. Jun's initial research is in line with these discussions focuses on:
  
  1. Can regulatory scrutiny be an important factor that determines the accounting policy that banks decide internally?
  2. How do investors understand the accounting numbers in banking industry and are these number conveying full set of information?
  3. Forward-looking or Incurred Loss: who is the winner in the battle field of loans?
  4. ...
  
  
- **Determinants of Financial Accounting Information Quality and Its Implications to Valuation and Investor Protection**

   This is indeed a collection of conventional research question in the field of accounting and finance (corporate finance) that has been regarded as highly matured and thus can find little room to work. However, till now, these issues are sitll of vital role and cannot be omitted under most mainstream research. Jun's current research is not working directly on the measure or theoretical implications of accounting information quality, e.g. possible misspecifications of Basu(1997)'s model and ways of improvements, the mechanisms of value-relevance on accounting numbers, etc. However, Jun is quite interested in knowing how these accounting quality measures can be affected by various determinants, and what about their implcations, e.g. the easy of external financing, improved/deteriorated marketing conditions, etc. 


- **The Transition of Corporate Governance and Ohher Factors thac Can Monitor Firms in Emerging Market**

  This is of great interest and of good value to have a thorough study of how and whether corporate governance mechanism that is imported from US and Europe decades ago can really work in a Chinese market environment given a significance on the backbone structure between these two different social structures, that US and European market is highly rule-based while most countries in East Asia, including China, are mainly personel-network-dominated. In this field, Jun is interested in that if there is any difference on the rounting that corporate governance codes can influence the firms' risk-taking behaviour, and whether the regulatory schemes in past few yeasrs can really tell us some stories about firms' efforts of protecting shareholders' wealth from unexpected losses.


- **Social Ties and Its Implications to Market Participants**

   Let's say something about that later, getting too tired to type all these words.
